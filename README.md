## Code Explanation
The provided code is a template for the Eternal Engine EA MT4. It includes the necessary libraries and functions to initialize, deinitialize, and handle tick events, trading logic, custom functions, utility functions, events, errors, and timers.

The `OnInit()` function is called during the EA's initialization. Code for custom initialization can be added here.

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. Code for custom deinitialization can be added here.

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick received. Code for tick processing can be added here.

The `OnStart()` function is the main processing loop of the EA. It contains the trading logic and other necessary functions for executing trades, capital protection, and adapting to market fluctuations.

The `CustomFunction()` and `UtilityFunction()` are placeholders for custom and utility functions that can be added as per the specific requirements of the algorithm.

The `OnEvent()` function is called when an event occurs. Code for event handling can be added here.

The `OnError()` function is called when an error occurs. Code for error handling can be added here.

The `OnTimer()` function is called on each timer event. Code for timer handling can be added here.
